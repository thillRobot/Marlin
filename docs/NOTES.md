# Marlin 

This is a README (NOTES.md) for the Marlin2 based 'Big-Printer'
I am currently updating the firmware t0 2.0.x or 2.0.7 and re-organizing the repos

Each printer will now have its own branch of thillRobot/Marlin which is fork of MarlinFirmware/Marlin.


First we are going to try 2.0.x and hope we do not run into the same issue as we did with the RAMBO. I think this is a long shot, but it is worth a try. This is a different board (EINSYRAMBO) with the same processor (MEGA2560)

instead of writing this readme from scratch I should use the one from the m2 as a template
